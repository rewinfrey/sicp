Exercise 1.4

Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

Given that b > 0,
Then the expression (if (> b 0) + -) returns the + operator
The + operator is used to form the new expression (+ a b)
And the compound expression defined as 'a-plus-abs-b' returns the value a + b

Given that b < 0,
Then the expression (if (> b 0) + -) returns the - operator
The - operator is used to form the new expression (- a b)
And the compound expression defined as 'a-plus-abs-b' returns the value a - b
